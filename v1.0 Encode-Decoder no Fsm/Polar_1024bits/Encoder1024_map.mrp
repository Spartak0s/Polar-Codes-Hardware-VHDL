Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     0 out of 408,000    0%
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      2,760 out of 204,000    1%
    Number used as logic:                    2,760 out of 204,000    1%
      Number using O6 output only:           2,384
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                  376
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  70,200    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,760
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,760 out of   2,760  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of   2,760    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of   2,760    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of 408,000    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Problem encountered during the packing phase.

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   2

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:701 - PAD symbol "inputs<511>" has an undefined IOSTANDARD.
WARNING:LIT:702 - PAD symbol "inputs<511>" is not constrained (LOC) to a
   specific location.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.970 Volts. (default - Range: 0.970 to
   1.030 Volts)
